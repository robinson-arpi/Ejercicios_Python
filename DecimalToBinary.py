'''
Convert a number to a binary coded decimal (BCD).

You can assume input will always be an integer. If it is a negative number then simply place a minus sign in front of the output string. Output will be a string with each digit of the input represented as 4 bits (0 padded) with a space between each set of 4 bits.

Ex.

n =  10 -> "0001 0000"
n = -10 -> "-0001 0000"
